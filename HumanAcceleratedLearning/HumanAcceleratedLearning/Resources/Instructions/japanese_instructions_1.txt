You will be presented with pairings of English words and their Japanese translations.
Each word pair will appear for 5 seconds
Please keep your eyes on the screen and focus on memorizing as many word pairings as possible. 

After this study session, we will begin with a testing session.
During testing, you will be presented with a Japanese word.
Your task is to type its correct English translation as quickly as possible (within the 8 seconds). 

Try your best to remember and type in the English translation as fast as you can. You will not be penalized for incorrect answers.

Both the study and testing phases of this experiment will occur 3 times, i.e. 3 blocks.
