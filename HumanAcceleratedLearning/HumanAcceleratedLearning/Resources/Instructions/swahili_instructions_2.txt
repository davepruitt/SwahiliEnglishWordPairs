You will now be tested on your ability to recall the English-Swahili word pairings that you learned on Visit 1 (1 week ago).
During this testing, you will be presented with a Swahili word for 8 seconds.
Your task is to type in its correct English translation as quickly as possible (within the 8 seconds).

Try your best to remember and type in the English translation as fast as you can. You will not be penalized for incorrect answers. 

On this visit, it will only be 1 block of testing.
