You will now be tested on your ability to recall the Object-Location pairings that you learned on Visit 1 (1 week ago).

During this testing, you will be presented with an object in the center of your screen for 8 seconds. 

Your task is to click the image then drag and drop it to its correct location as quickly as possible (within the 8 seconds).

Try your best to remember and select the correct location as fast as you can. You will not be penalized for incorrect answers.
