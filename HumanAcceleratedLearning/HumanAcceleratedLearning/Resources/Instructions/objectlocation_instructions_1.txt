You will be presented with images that are located on a grid.
Each image will appear for 5 seconds before being replaced by another image.  
Please keep your eyes on the screen and focus on memorizing as many object-location pairings as possible.

After this study session, we will begin with a testing session. 
During testing, you will be presented with an image in the middle of your screen.
Your task is to click on the image and drag it to the correct location (within the 8 seconds). 

Try your best to remember and drag the image to the correct location as fast as you can.  You will not be penalized for incorrect answers. 

Both the study and testing phases of this experiment will occur 3 times.
